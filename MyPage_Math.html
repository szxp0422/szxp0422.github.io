		<h2>List of representative problems<h2>
		<h3>Algebra</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Question 1 (arguably could be leaning towards geo):</b> On the coordinate plane, \(y = 0\) is a river. Boo the bear is currently at \((0, 8)\). He needs to get to \((81, 5)\) where his home is. 
		But being the hungry and thirsty bear of the den, he decides to choose a point along the river to stop for a drink and find the dead carcass of a deer at \((21, 20)\). 
		Determine the shortest distance Boo the bear needs to travel. (problem credits: me)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Solution 1:</b> There are two cases in this problem. The first one is the bear visits the river, then the carcass. The second one is the bear first visits the carcass, then the river. In both cases, we rely on the
		idea that the shortest distance between two points \((a, b)\) and \((c,d)\), all positive values with \(c > a\), that must hit the x-axis is equivalent to $$\sqrt{(c-a)^2 +(b + d)^2}$$
		<b>Case 1:</b> The distance travelled by the bear to reach the carcass is equal to \(\sqrt{21^2 + (20 + 8)^2} = 35\). The distance from the carcass to his home is equal to \(\sqrt{(81-21)^2 + (20-5)^2} = 15\sqrt{17}\).
		Thus, the total distance for case 1 is \(35 + 15\sqrt{17}\). <br>
		<b>Case 2:</b> The distance travelled by the bear to reach the carcass is equal to \(\sqrt{21^2 + (20-8)^2} = 3\sqrt{65}\). The distance from the carcass to his home is equal to \(\sqrt{(81-21)^2 + (20+5)^2} = 65\).
		Thus, the total distance for case 2 is \(3\sqrt{65} + 65\). <br>
		Comparing the two values, we find that the smaller of the two is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{65} + 65}\)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Question 2:</b> The polynomial \(f(x) = x^4-4x^3+15x^2+38x+50\) has 4 complex roots that can be graphed on the complex plane. Find the area formed by the 4 points on the complex plane. (problem credits: me)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Solution 2:</b> Because we know that there are 4 complex roots and the resulting coefficients are all real numbers, then the 4 roots must form 2 complex conjugate pairs. We set one of these pairs 
		to be \(a + bi\) and \(a - bi\). When multiplying this out, we get \((x-(a+bi))(x-(a-bi)) = x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + b^2\). If we let the other pair be \(c + di\) and \(c - di\), without loss of generality, we get
		\(x^2 -2cx + c^2 + d^2\). This means that after factoring 50, the constant term, the result should be represented by the product of the sum of two squares. We note that 
		\(50 = (1^2 + 1^2)(3^2 + 4^2) = (1^2 + 2^2)(1^2 + 3^2)\). After testing both, we find that \(a = -1\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 3\), \(d = 4\) works. Thus, the 4 points on the complex plane are 
		\((-1, 1)\), \((-1, -1)\), \((3,4)\), and \((3, -4)\). This is a trapezoid with the two bases as 2 and 8, with a height of 4, which means that the area is \(\frac{4(2 + 8)}{2} = \boxed{20}\).
		</p>
		<h3>Geometry</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Question 1:</b> Two circles of radius 4 and 3 intersect at point \(X\). The distance between the two centers is 5. We then draw the common tangent line, closer to \(X\), of the two circles. 
		The tangent points are \(Y\) and \(Z\). Find the area of \(\triangle{XYZ}\). (problem credits: me)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Solution 1:</b> The diagram looks as follows:
		</p>
		<center><img src="geo1.jpg" alt="Geometry Problem 1" class = "center" style="width:600px;height:450px"></center>
		<p>
		Note that the area of \(\triangle{XYZ}\) is equalivalent to the area of the trapezoid \(ABZY\) subtracted by the area of triangle \(ABX\), \(BXZ\), and \(AXY\). The area of trapezoid \(ABZY\) can be found to be
		$$\frac{1}{2} \cdot (3 + 4) \cdot \sqrt{5^2 - (4-3)^2} = 7\sqrt{6}$$ Then we find the area of each triangle. Because \(ABX\) is a right triangle, determined by the side lengths, the area is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 6\).
		The area of triangle \(BXZ\) can be found as follows:
		\begin{equation*}
		\frac{1}{2}\cdot 3^2 \cdot \sin{ZBX} = \frac{9}{2} \cdot \sin{ZBA - XBA}\\
		= \frac{9}{2} \cdot (\sin{ZBA}\cos{XBA} - \sin{XBA}\cos{ZBA})\\
		= \frac{9}{2} \cdot (\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}\cdot\frac{3}{5} - \frac{4}{5}\cdot(-\frac{1}{5}))\\
		= \frac{9}{2} \cdot (\frac{6\sqrt{6}}{25} + \frac{4}{25})\\
		= \frac{27\sqrt{6} + 18}{25}
		\end{equation*}
		The area of triangle \(AXY\) can be found as follows:
		\begin{equation*}
		\frac{1}{2}\cdot 4^2 \cdot \sin{XAY} = 8 \cdot \sin{BAY - BAX}\\
		= 8 \cdot (\sin{BAY}\cos{BAX} - \sin{BAX}\cos{BAY})\\
		= 8 \cdot (\frac{2\sqrt{6}}{5}\cdot\frac{4}{5} - \frac{3}{5}\cdot\frac{1}{5})\\
		= 8 \cdot \frac{8\sqrt{6} - 3}{25}\\
		= \frac{64\sqrt{6} - 24}{25}
		\end{equation*}
		Thus, the area of the triangle \(XYZ\) is equal to $$7\sqrt{6} - 6 - \frac{27\sqrt{6} + 18}{25} - \frac{64\sqrt{6} - 24}{25} = \boxed{\frac{84\sqrt{6}-144}{25}}$$
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Question 2:</b> Let \(\triangle{ABC}\) be an isosceles triangle where \(AB = AC = 5\sqrt{2}\) and \(BC = 2\). The point \(D\) is defined to be the intersection of \(AC\) and the circle with diameter \(AB\).
		Let point \(E\) be the midpoint of the arc \(AB\) that does not include point \(D\). Find the area of \(\triangle{CDE\).
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Solution 2:</b> We know that the midpoint, \(M\) of \(BC\) also likes on the circle. Then by power of a point $$CM \cdot CB = CD \cdot CA$$ Thus \(CD = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{5}\). Then, we need the distance between
		\(E\) and the line \(AC\). Because \(E\) is the midpoint of the arc \(AB\), \(AE = 5\). The height can then be found as $$5\sin{EAC} = 5\sin{(45 + 2 \cdot CAM)} = \frac{31\sqrt{2}}{10}$$ Thus, the area is equal to
		$$\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{5} \cdot \frac{31\sqrt{2}}{10} = \boxed{\frac{31}{50}}$$
		</p>
		<h3>Number Theory</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Question 1:</b> Given that a value \(x\), when divided by all primes less than 6 leave a remainder of 1 less than the prime, what is the second smallest possible value of \(x\). (problem credits: me)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Solution 1:</b> The primes less than 6 are 2, 3, and 5. Thus \(x \equiv 1 \pmod 2\), \(x \equiv 2 \pmod 3\), and \(x\equiv 4 \pmod 5\). The smallest value of \(x\) is thus 29 by Chinese Remainder theorem.
		The second smallest value is then \(29 + 2\cdot3\cdot5 = \boxed{59}\).
		</p>
		<h3>Combo</h3>
		<p>
		<b>Question 1:</b> Eric has a hard test and a magical coin. If he flips heads then he will solve the next 2 problems correctly, but if he flips tails he will solve the next 3 problems 
		correctly and solve the \(4^{th}\) one incorrectly. Given that he flips heads with probability 1/3, what is the expected number of problems incorrect on a 10 question test? (If the flip causes 
		the number of problems to go over the number of problems on the test, then assume that he solves the remaining questions correctly.) (problem credits: me)
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Solution 1:</b> There are 4 cases that will be considered here: 5 heads 0 tails, 3 heads 1 tail, 1 head 2 tails, and 0 heads 3 tails. In the first case, Eric will miss 0 problems. In the second case, Eric 
		will always miss exactly 1 problem. The second case happens with probability \((\frac{1}{3})^3\cdot\frac{2}{3}\cdot 4 = \frac{8}{81}\). In the third case, Eric will always miss 2 problems. This happens with 
		probability \(\frac{1}{3} \cdot (\frac{2}{3})^2 \cdot 3 = \frac{4}{9}\). Thus, the expected value is \(\frac{4}{9} \cdot 2 = \frac{8}{9}\). In the last case, Eric will always miss 2 problems. This happens with
		probability \((\frac{2}{3})^3 = \frac{8}{27}\). Thus the expected value is \(\frac{8}{27} \cdot 2 = \frac{16}{27}\). Summing up the total expected values, the answer is thus, $$\frac{8}{81} + \frac{8}{9} + \frac{16}{27} = \boxed{\frac{128}{81}}$$
