		<h1>Hardware</h1>
		<h2>Tools</h2>
		<p>Below is a list of the tools that I experimented with and their functions:
		<ul>
		<li>Breadboard: These are where the electrical circuit prototypes are made so that they can be
		 tested before minimization. They are electrically connected in a certain way, which makes it
		 important to know how to connect different strips.</li>
		<li>Resistors: These are passive, electronic components which have a specific, never-changing electrical
		 resistance. The resistor's resitance limits the flow of electrons through a circuit, which is calculated
		 using Ohm's law (which states that voltage is equal to current times resistance). Because they are passive, they do not consume or generate power. They
		 are used to limit currents, divide voltages, and pull-up I/O lines (input and output lines). The electrical 
		 resistance of a resistor is measured in ohms, \(\Omega\). Note that most resistors will have color bands on 
		 them that identifies what resistance they are.</li>
		<li>Capacitors: These are also passive components that store electrical energy in an electric field. 
		The ability for a system to store electrical charge is called capacitance and is measured in farads (F). 
		Voltage across the capacitor and its capacitance dictates how much charge is stored in it using the formula
		$$\text{Q (charge)} = \text{C (capacitance)} \cdot \text{V (voltage)}$$ The current flowing through the 
		capacitator is dictated by the capacitance and the rate of voltage change across the capacitor using the 
		formula
		$$\text{I (current)} = \text{C (capacitance)} \cdot \frac{d\text{V}}{d\text{T}}\text{ (rate of change of voltage wrt time)}$$</li>
		<li>Inductors: These are also passive components that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric 
		current flows through. Iductance (units = Henries[H]) is a measure of an inductors "resistance" to the change 
		of the current flowing through the circuit. An important formula: $$\text{V (voltage)} = \text{L (inductance in henries)} \cdot \frac{d\text{I}}{d\text{T}}$$</li>
		<li>Male/Female Wires: These are just wires that transmit electrical currents. They are called male and female 
		wires because the parts that connect are different.</li>
		<li>Senors: There are many sensors that are used in the real world. A few of the most common ones are: 
		Temperature, infrared, photoresistor, humidity, pressure, photoencoders</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Circuit Principles</h2>
		<p>
		There are four principles of circuits. The first one is that the current will always travel down the past of least 
		resistance. This means that a current will not go through a resistor if there is an alternate path that is just 
		a wire. The second is that nodes in a circuite share an endpoint. Each node has the same voltage through out it. 
		The third one is set as two rules: Kirchhoffs Circuit Law (KCL) and Kirchhoffs Voltage Law (KVL).  KCL states that the total 
		current or charge entering a junction or node is exactly equal to the charge leaving the node as a node is passive. 
		KVL states that in any closed loop network, the total voltage around the loop is equal to the sum of all the voltages 
		within the same loop, which is equal to 0. The last one is series vs parallel. Elements in series share an endpoint node. Elements in parallel 
		share both start and end node.
		</p>
		<h2>Resistance Calculation</h2>
		<p>
		If there are \(n\) 
		resistors, with resistance \(R_1, R_2, \dots, R_n\) respectively, the total resistance can be found. If they are 
		in series, then the total resistance is just their sum. If they were in parallel, the total resistance would be found 
		using $$\frac{1}{R_{tot}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{R_n}$$
		</p>
		<p>
		An example for solving the Wheatstone Bridge circuit is shown below.

		<h2>Operation amplifiers ("op-amps")</h2>
		<p>
		Each op-amp has two input terminals (V+, V-), 
		2 rails (Vs+, Vs-), and one output terminal (Vout). These are very important because they add/multiply/differentiate/integrate 
		signals, stabilize signals, filter signals, separates circuits to prevent loading effect, and amplify only true signals. For 
		the ideal op-amp, there are 3 golden rules:
		<ul>
		<li>The op-amp has infinite open-loop gain.</li>
		<li>No current flows into the +/- inputs of the op-amp</li>
		<li>V+ = V-</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<img src="idealopamp.JPG" alt="Ideal op-amp" class = "center" style="width:400px;height:300px">
		<p>
		There are four common op-amp configurations: Comparator, Buffer, Non-inverting Amplifier, and Inverting Amplifier. 
		The comparator compares two signals and rails to Vs+ or Vs- depending on which input (V- or V+) is larger. If V+ is larger, 
		then Vout = Vs+. If V- is larger, then Vout = Vs-. If they are equal, then Vout is the average of Vs+ and Vs-. 
		Under comparators, we have a special case, called negative and positive feedback where the V- or V+ is directly 
		connected to Vout. Negative feedback is used more more often and it is used in control systems to create well controlled 
		signals. This is because Vout = A(V+ - V-). The buffer configuration mirrors a voltage from a high-impendance input to a  
		low inmpendance output. Non-inverting amplifiers are the opposite of inverting amplifiers which has an output voltage 180 
		degrees out of phase with the input voltage.
