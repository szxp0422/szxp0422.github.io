		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hello! My name, if you can't tell based on the biggest words on the screen, is Steven Pan, and I am 17, meaning that I am still legally not allowed to do many things. I cannot vote, gamble (probably for the better), or 
		drive (perfectly legal, just haven't gotten my permit or my liscence). But these limitations cannot stop me. I do vote, but only for school events and student council. I gamble, but only against myself by betting on certain outcomes
		of my solitaire game. And I absolutely do drive, but not a real car; only a fresh out of the lot, electric, top speed 12 mile per hour golf cart a.k.a. the golf-mobile. Other than looking forward to what I can do in a 
		few months and searching for ways to do it early, I enjoy playing golf, doing math, coding interactive games, reading, gardening, and sleeping (not in any particular order).
		</p>
		<p>
		So what am I truly like besides the activities that I do? Well, according to the 16 personalities website, I am an virtuoso or ISTP-A (introverted, observant, thinking, and prospecting). Though these four adjectives are somewhat correct,
		they make me seem like I am the creepy dude at a party standing in the corner watching and analyzing everyone's move. Not to mention, no one can read what's going on in my mind. That is only accurate up to the point of being the non-social person at a party.
		Personally, I'd like to believe that I am a funny and interesting person to be around, but that's not up to me to decide. However, I have nearly perfected the craft of snarky one-liners and cringe-worthy puns that even dad jokes don't stand a chance against. 
		I am very carefree and like to let life flow along without many major disturbances. I am very observant, but only use the information I gather to prepare myself for the various situations that I may have to face in the future.
		Now that you probably have an overall image of what I am like, go explore some other slides and see what you like!
		</p>
